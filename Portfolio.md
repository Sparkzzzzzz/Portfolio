Hi, I am Hridaan Sarvagyaa, a Python bot developer developing Discord bots for more than 2 years now. I have a fairly complete understanding of the Discord Api and related packages and modules like math, random, SciPy, Matplotlib, requests, etc. I also have an almost complete understanding of Python and its workings.

### I have also made other bots like CeneBot (A discord bot for a youtuber's server),</br>Lens Bot (A bot for Minet Lens), and Mis Bot (A bot for the Mis Discord); But cannot</br> share the links to the same due to a potential compromise of the bot tokens.
